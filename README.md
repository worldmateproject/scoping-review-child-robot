# Systematic-Review
This review examines the role of Human-Robot and Child-Robot Interaction in early childhood education, with a focus on language acquisition. It explores how social robots process multimodal inputs (speech, gaze, gestures) to enhance communication, sustain engagement, and adapt to children’s needs. Key topics include adaptive learning systems, emotion detection, real-time interaction, and ethical considerations such as privacy and emotional well-being. By highlighting current advancements and challenges, this paper provides insights for improving robot-assisted language learning and child development.

**Systematic Review Query Analysis Report**

***Query Summary***
After conducting a systematic filtering and analysis of the queries designed to retrieve relevant papers from IEEE Xplore, the query labeled as Q10 is identified as the most comprehensive query. This query encompasses all the papers retrieved by the previous nine queries (Q1-Q9). Below is the detailed breakdown:

| Query ID | Query Key Search | Papers Retrieved (IEEE Xplore) |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Q1       | (“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction”) AND (“Robots”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning”) AND (“Child” OR “Childhood” OR “Children”) | 358 |
| Q2       | (“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction”) AND (“Robots” OR “Social Robots”) AND (“Community” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning”) | 1425 |
| Q3       | (“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction”) AND (“Robots” OR “Social Robots”) AND (“Community” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child Directed Speech”) | 1480 |
| Q4       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child* OR “Community” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Talker”)) | 2596 |
| Q5       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child*”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Talker”)) | 604 |
| Q6       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Community*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Speech Interaction” OR “Talker”)) | 3186 |
| Q7       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Speech Interaction” OR “Talker”)) | 690 |
| Q8       | ((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Teach*” OR “Child-Directed” OR “Speech” OR “Language” OR “Communication”)) | 2410 |
| Q9       | (((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Language” OR “Communication” OR “Teach*” OR “Talker”)) ) | 4065 |
| Q10      | ((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed” OR "Speech" OR “Languag*” OR “Communicat*” OR “Teach*” OR “Talker”)) | **4165** |


***Description:***

1. After analyzing the queries for the systematic review, Q10 has been identified as the most comprehensive query.
2. Reason: Query Q10 retrieves 4165 papers, covering all papers retrieved by the previous nine queries (Q1–Q9) from IEEE Xplore.
3. Key Action: Use Q10 as the final query for systematic review to ensure no relevant paper is missed.
