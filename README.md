## Systematic Review on Child-Robot Interaction in Early Childhood Education

This systematic review examines the methodologies and impacts of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Child-Robot Interaction (CRI) within early childhood education, emphasizing language acquisition, adaptive learning systems, and multimodal communication (speech, gaze, gestures). It addresses the role of social robots in enhancing engagement, learning outcomes, and developmental progress, alongside ethical considerations like privacy and emotional well-being.

## Search Query

### Key Trends

* Publication volume significantly increased (2015-2024), peaking in 2024.
* ACM yielded the highest number of papers; PubMed had the fewest due to specific domain relevance.
* Data for 2025 suggests incomplete data or changing research interests.

## Duplicate and Irrelevant Paper Removal

Duplicate entries and papers categorized as theoretical frameworks or literature reviews were excluded:

| Source           | IEEE | WoS  | SD   | Scopus | ACM  | PubMed | Total     |
| ---------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | --------- |
| Remaining Papers | 3954 | 2852 | 2267 | 7131   | 5672 | 423    | **22299** |

## Initial Relevance Filtering

Screening abstracts, titles, and keywords against set criteria:

### Inclusion Criteria

* Empirical studies involving child-robot interactions.
* Educational and developmental outcomes (language, social skills).
* Quantifiable engagement and cognitive development measures.
* Typically developing child populations.

### Exclusion Criteria

* Non-empirical papers (reviews, theoretical discussions).
* Papers lacking clear educational outcomes.
* General HRI without specific child focus.
* Neurodivergent populations or unrelated contexts.

Initial screening identified **6412 relevant papers**:

| Source   | IEEE | WoS  | SD   | Scopus | ACM  | PubMed | Total |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| Relevant | 1407 | 1222 | 1501 | 865    | 1331 | 86     | 6412  |

## Refined Filtering

Further filtering emphasized studies explicitly addressing typically developing children and language development:

| Source   | IEEE | WoS | SD  | Scopus | ACM | PubMed | Total    |
| -------- | ---- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | ------ | -------- |
| Relevant | 604  | 576 | 477 | 370    | 429 | 46     | **2502** |

## Final Paper Set

Full-text review finalized a set of **211 empirical studies** specifically targeting:

* Educational settings and language acquisition.
* Communication skills of typically developing children.
* Clearly quantifiable developmental outcomes.

This collection represents rigorously selected, peer-reviewed evidence for informed research and practice in robotic interaction in early childhood education.
