# Systematic-Review
This review examines the role of Human-Robot and Child-Robot Interaction in early childhood education, with a focus on language acquisition. It explores how social robots process multimodal inputs (speech, gaze, gestures) to enhance communication, sustain engagement, and adapt to children’s needs. Key topics include adaptive learning systems, emotion detection, real-time interaction, and ethical considerations such as privacy and emotional well-being. By highlighting current advancements and challenges, this paper provides insights for improving robot-assisted language learning and child development.

## Pre-Query Analysis Report

This report presents an analysis of the queries used in the systematic review process. Each query was assessed for its ability to capture relevant studies, and based on this evaluation, the most comprehensive query was identified. 

| Query ID | Query Key Search | Papers Retrieved (IEEE Xplore) |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Q1       | (“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction”) AND (“Robots”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning”) AND (“Child” OR “Childhood” OR “Children”) | 358 |
| Q2       | (“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction”) AND (“Robots” OR “Social Robots”) AND (“Community” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning”) | 1425 |

| Q4       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child* OR “Community” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Talker”)) | 2596 |
| Q5       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child*”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learning” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Talker”)) | 604 |
| Q6       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Community*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Speech Interaction” OR “Talker”)) | 3186 |
| Q7       | ((“Human-Robot Interaction” OR “Child-Robot Interaction” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Speech Interaction” OR “Talker”)) | 690 |
| Q8       | ((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot”) AND (“Robot”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social”) AND (“Education” OR “School” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Teach*” OR “Child-Directed” OR “Speech” OR “Language” OR “Communication”)) | 2410 |
| Q9       | (((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed Speech” OR “Language” OR “Communication” OR “Teach*” OR “Talker”)) ) | 4065 |
| Q10      | ((“Human-Robot” OR “Child-Robot” OR “Interaction”) AND (“Robot*”) AND (“Child*” OR “Communit*” OR “Social*”) AND (“Education*” OR “School*” OR “Learn*” OR “Caregiver” OR “Child-Directed” OR "Speech" OR “Languag*” OR “Communicat*” OR “Teach*” OR “Talker”)) | **4165** |

The analysis showed that Query Q10 retrieved the largest number of papers (4,165), including all papers captured by the previous nine queries (Q1–Q9) from IEEE Xplore. As a result, Q10 is considered the most comprehensive query for this systematic review and will be used as the final query to ensure that no relevant papers are overlooked.
